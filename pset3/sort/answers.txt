sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50000.txt -> 6.490s
sorted50000.txt -> 1.468s

For sorted files, sort1 was the fastest in sorting them.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50000.txt -> 3.213s
sorted50000.txt -> 1.996s

For a reversed txt file of 50,000 numbers, it was exponentially faster compared to the other sorting programs.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50000.txt -> 4.193s
sorted50000.txt -> 3.808s

It was the slowest sorting program in both a reversed number text file, as well as a sorted txt file. Hence we can conclude that this is selection sort.
